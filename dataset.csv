The policeman having requested his prisonersfor so, truly, they might be calledto descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said:  You will appear before Judge Obadiah at halfpast eight. He then retired, and closed the door."
with,a,was,conceal,is,"Why, we are prisoners! exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair. Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: Sir, you must leave me to my fate!  It is on my account that you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me! Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible.  It"
at,unlikely,to,complainants,was,"was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee. The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge. There was some mistake.  Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong. But the steamer leaves at noon! observed Passepartout, nervously."
by,on,reassured,said,it,"We shall be on board by noon, replied his master, placidly. It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself, Parbleu that's certain!  Before noon we shall be on board. But he was by no means reassured. At halfpast eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and,"
took,the,follow,and,hall,"requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall.  It was evidently a courtroom, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment. Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk.  Immediately after, Judge"
her,was,kong,board,young,"as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished.  However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please."
and,with,be,he,done,"During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done.  The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her, apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the"
he,himself,to,not,movements,"watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort.  He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk.  He treated her with the strictest politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose.  Aouda did not quite know"
smile,all,of,masters,medium,"what to make of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world.  After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude."
was,great,confirmed,a,english,"Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history. She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government.  Aouda was a relative of this great man, and"
sacred,her,of,very,the,"it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong. Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything would be mathematicallyhe used the very wordarranged.  Aouda fastened her great eyes, clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,"
into,the,they,the,inclined,"upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake. The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its"
savage,lowest,but,hundred,papuans,"picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming above the waters.  The steamer passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance. The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.  Vast"
outlines,to,tables,the,of,"forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and treelike ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire.  The varied"
seas,passed,to,this,what,"landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave access to the China seas. What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country, doing all this while?  He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at"
voyage,board,by,him,difficult,"Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay."
hong,at,would,centred,for,"But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant, as will be seen. All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there.  The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the"
beyond,refuge,for,fogg,make,"robber would probably escape him for ever.  Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge.  If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no"
these,would,warrant,and,probabilities,"further trouble.  But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice. Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he"
is,case,hong,his,failed,"spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, Now, either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure.  I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost:  Cost what"
worth,were,but,there,passengers,"Captain Speedy began to scratch his head.  There were eight thousand dollars to gain, without changing his route; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers. Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers, but valuable merchandise.  I start at nine o'clock, said Captain"
to,st,return,you,at,"Speedy, simply.  Are you and your party ready? We will be on board at nine o'clock, replied, no less simply, Mr. Fogg. It was halfpast eight.  To disembark from the Henrietta, jump into a hack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout,"
on,even,was,throughout,heard,"and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time, and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him. They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor. When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost, he uttered a prolonged Oh! which extended throughout his vocal gamut."
the,have,of,himself,of,"As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified.  When they reached England, even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bankbills into the sea, more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent! IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION"
directed,island,henrietta,an,eastward,"An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea. During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and directed her course rapidly eastward. At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the"
pardonable,key,as,least,loud,"vessel's position.  It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy. Not the least in the world.  It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.  As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive."
liverpool,only,had,what,been,"What had happened was very simple.  Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.  Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on"
this,terms,speedy,the,directing,"the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.  This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool.  It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor."
did,become,she,his,the,"How the adventure ended will be seen anon.  Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing.  As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre simply glorious.  The captain had said between eleven and twelve knots, and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction. If, thenfor there were ifs stillthe sea did not become too"
of,henrietta,bank,three,boat,"boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December.  It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank"
days,the,the,england,and,"of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire. During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.  The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the northeast, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves"
he,ignored,amazed,fellow,which,"like a real transAtlantic steamer. Passepartout was delighted.  His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.  Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.  He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.  He thought they"
the,often,only,like,and,"managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes.  His loquacious goodhumour infected everyone.  He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.  He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.  Often,"
their,managing,but,old,the,"also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed. Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing"
but,not,of,not,to,"the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.  He did not know what to think.  For, after all, a man who began by stealing fiftyfive thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the"
began,courageous,least,a,it,"world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety.  The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair. As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as"
captain,they,board,frequent,banks,"he was, took the greatest precautions.  Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board. On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind.  Ever since the evening before the"
the,was,veered,varied,deviate,"barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered to the southeast. This was a misfortune.  Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the"
her,herself,against,it,speed,"vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern.  She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress.  The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves."
headway,the,against,deck,her,"Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright.  But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam.  The Henrietta, when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but"
beating,a,however,of,straight,"passing safely.  Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead. The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with"
sails,the,from,not,the,"a speed of ninety miles an hour.  It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it remained obstinately in the southeast, rendering the sails useless. The 16th of December was the seventyfifth day since Phileas Fogg's departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed.  Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst"
in,comforted,bad,count,failed,"localities had been passed.  In summer, success would have been wellnigh certain.  In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season.  Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam."
and,sure,engineer,day,mr,"On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him.  Without knowing why it was a presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.  He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying.  He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard"
engineer,our,of,from,bordeaux,"his master say, You are certain of what you tell me? Certain, sir, replied the engineer.  You must remember that, since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool. I"
hell,mortal,to,could,consider,"will consider, replied Mr. Fogg. Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.  The coal was giving out!  Ah, if my master can get over that, muttered he, he'll be a famous man!  He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard."
then,believe,the,vigorously,are,"Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool? Of course. Ass! replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel. Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the"
around,selfesteem,a,fix,difficult,"reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his selfesteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world, and refrained. And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?  It was difficult to"
feed,nevertheless,steam,for,decided,"imagine.  Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted. A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke.  The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on"
day,having,let,the,fires,"the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day. Do not let the fires go down, replied Mr. Fogg.  Keep them up to the last.  Let the valves be filled. Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called"
and,bomb,that,was,honest,"Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.  It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.  He went to the poop, saying to himself, He will be like a madman! In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poopdeck.  The bomb was Captain Speedy.  It was clear that he was on"
had,we,man,permitted,poor,"the point of bursting.  Where are we?  were the first words his anger permitted him to utter.  Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath. Where are we? he repeated, with purple face. Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool, replied Mr. Fogg, with"
captain,obliged,to,but,cried,"No!  By all the devils, no! But I shall be obliged to burn her. Burn the Henrietta! Yes; at least the upper part of her.  The coal has given out. Burn my vessel! cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce"
replied,american,the,words,the,"the words.  A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars! Here are sixty thousand, replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bankbills.  This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.  An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars.  The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,"
tone,would,was,the,it,"and all his grudges against his passenger.  The Henrietta was twenty years old; it was a great bargain.  The bomb would not go off after all.  Mr. Fogg had taken away the match. And I shall still have the iron hull, said the captain in a softer tone."
as,colloquy,the,his,is,"The iron hull and the engine.  Is it agreed? Agreed. And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket. During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix"
said,fogg,captain,hull,twenty,"seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.  Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!  It was true, however, that fiftyfive thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank. When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, Don't"
at,sir,i,i,new,"let this astonish you, sir.  You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December.  I missed the steamer at New York, and as you refused to take me to Liverpool And I did well! cried Andrew Speedy; for I have gained at least"
you,the,passenger,and,he,"forty thousand dollars by it!  He added, more sedately, Do you know one thing, Captain Fogg. Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you. And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he"
and,have,burn,interior,the,"was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, The vessel now belongs to me? Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the mastsall the wood, that Very well.  Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down, and burn them. It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate"
and,spars,and,next,away,"pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck were sacrificed.  On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts, rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the fires.  Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might. There was a perfect rage for demolition."
twentyfour,the,hulk,20th,sighted,"The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk. But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.  By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown.  Phileas Fogg had only twentyfour hours more in which to get to London; that length of time"
against,the,commiserate,necessary,everything,"was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.  And the steam was about to give out altogether! Sir, said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg's project, I really commiserate you.  Everything is against you.  We are only opposite Queenstown."
we,without,yes,stay,the,"Ah, said Mr. Fogg, is that place where we see the lights Queenstown? Yes. Can we enter the harbour? Not under three hours.  Only at high tide. Stay, replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that"
mr,said,not,of,been,"ruined, but now you are rich again. Pardon me, madam; my fortune belongs to you.  If you had not suggested our marriage, my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel Wilson's, I should not have been apprised of my error, and Dear Mr. Fogg! said the young woman."
not,glowing,entitled,light,this,"Dear Aouda! replied Phileas Fogg. It need not be said that the marriage took place fortyeight hours after, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave the bride away.  Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour? The next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped vigorously"
made,the,mr,world,found,"at his master's door.  Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, What's the matter, Passepartout? What is it, sir?  Why, I've just this instant found out What? That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventyeight"
my,the,but,have,crossed,"days. No doubt, returned Mr. Fogg, by not crossing India.  But if I had not crossed India, I should not have saved Aouda; she would not have been my wife, and Mr. Fogg quietly shut the door."
had,phileas,qualities,had,all,"Phileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around the world in eighty days.  To do this he had employed every means of conveyancesteamers, railways, carriages, yachts, tradingvessels, sledges, elephants.  The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude.  But what"
a,for,made,say,charming,"then?  What had he really gained by all this trouble?  What had he brought back from this long and weary journey? Nothing, say you?  Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, who, strange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men! Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?"
concerns,about,eve,closely,century,THE EVE OF THE WAR. No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than manâ€™s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and
this,and,over,their,globe,"studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do"
there,the,danger,to,sources,"the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to"
intellects,across,eyes,welcome,the,"themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great"
world,the,of,i,the,"disillusionment. The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;"
before,could,accelerated,of,have,"and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence."
that,at,to,idea,understood,"Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the"
remoter,its,physical,superficial,is,"superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from timeâ€™s beginning but nearer its end. The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region"
pole,its,periodically,and,that,"the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to"
their,see,of,for,nearest,"us is still incredibly remote, has become a presentday problem for the inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only"
planet,a,a,warmer,miles,"35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow, navycrowded seas."
alien,them,already,are,us,"And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this"
crowded,is,too,them,only,"world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation, creeps upon them. And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless"
extermination,of,races,such,bison,"and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy"
it,in,spirit,descent,we,"as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit? The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtletyâ€”their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of oursâ€”and to have carried out their preparations with a wellnigh perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen"
countless,is,has,the,planetâ€”it,"the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planetâ€”it is odd, bythebye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of warâ€”but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready."
first,it,in,light,was,"During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk"
the,lavelle,burst,their,their,"into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions. The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange"
occurred,outbreak,once,spectroscope,velocity,"palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted, indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become"
little,a,as,there,past,"invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, as flaming gases rushed out of a gun. A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily"
turn,in,of,not,his,"Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the wellknown astronomer, at Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a"
slit,little,the,remember,telescope,"scrutiny of the red planet. In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roofâ€”an"
but,and,across,through,swimming,"oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field. It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect"
the,this,light,i,but,"round. But so little it was, so silvery warmâ€”a pinâ€™s head of light! It was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view. As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty"
of,immensity,dust,the,points,"millions of miles it was from usâ€”more than forty millions of miles of void. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims. Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light, three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the"
flying,a,thousands,profounder,and,"unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder. And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were"
of,of,out,slightest,i,"sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile. That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection"
that,was,as,came,took,"of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty, and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us."
my,i,crimson,way,blackness,"That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars, just a second or so under twentyfour hours after the first one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I"
lantern,sleeping,darkness,all,seen,"had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace. He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and"
upon,meteorites,shower,might,volcanic,"scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets."
earth,the,again,saw,chances,"The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one, he said. Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth"
has,visible,grey,fluctuating,a,"has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches, spread through the clearness of the planetâ€™s atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features."
and,us,and,everywhere,volcanoes,"Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy use of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a"
pace,remember,day,for,of,"pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the"
developments,illustrated,our,busy,for,"illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenthcentury papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed."
i,starlight,out,was,one,"One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of"
or,sound,the,melody,brightness,"excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the"
seen,early,seemed,safe,a,"red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil. THE FALLING STAR. Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the"
denning,it,seemed,to,for,"atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth"
up,him,the,although,hour,"about one hundred miles east of him. I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space"
myself,that,a,was,fall,"must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No"
ottershaw,the,and,seems,somewhere,"one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night. But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the"
had,made,fire,impact,gravel,"sandpits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away. The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn."
about,fragments,softened,of,the,"The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder, caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly duncoloured incrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached"
noise,size,at,unequal,or,"the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach. A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it"
evidence,might,the,perceiving,still,"might be hollow. He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and"
was,already,was,he,the,"the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the common."
his,off,noticed,the,that,"Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker, the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth."
this,meant,ash,excessive,close,"For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to see the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder."
cylinder,him,only,five,circumference,"And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the cylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,"
jerk,end,good,an,him,until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The cylinder was artificialâ€”hollowâ€”with an end that screwed out! Something within the cylinder was unscrewing the top! Good heavens! said Ogilvy. Thereâ€™s a man in itâ€”men in it! Half
and,to,at,cylinder,forgot,"roasted to death! Trying to escape! At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash upon Mars. The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But"
a,six,him,scrambled,make,"luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands on the stillglowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment, then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into Woking. The time then must have been somewhere about six oâ€™clock. He met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told"
a,equally,the,of,unsuccessful,and his appearance were so wildâ€”his hat had fallen off in the pitâ€”that the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman who was just unlocking the doors of the publichouse by Horsell Bridge. The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and
henderson,called,over,that,he,"when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called over the palings and made himself understood. Henderson, he called, you saw that shooting star last night? Well? said Henderson. Itâ€™s out on Horsell Common now."
inside,whatâ€™s,cylinderâ€”an,but,one,"Good Lord! said Henderson. Fallen meteorite! Thatâ€™s good. But itâ€™s something more than a meteorite. Itâ€™s a cylinderâ€”an artificial cylinder, man! And thereâ€™s something inside. Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand. Whatâ€™s that? he said. He was deaf in one ear."
a,jacket,the,still,then,"Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and came out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common, and found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed"
either,sizzling,the,or,and,"between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound. They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and, meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside must be insensible or dead."
running,anything,course,opening,help,"Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered, running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their"
the,bedroom,oâ€™clock,to,into,"bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had prepared menâ€™s minds for the reception of the idea. By eight oâ€™clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already started for the common to see the dead men from Mars. That was the"
sandpits,in,i,to,time,"form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the Ottershaw bridge to the sandpits. ON HORSELL COMMON."
ogilvy,huge,no,which,impact,"I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there."
was,edge,after,and,gone,"I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and had gone away to breakfast at Hendersonâ€™s house. There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their feet dangling, and amusing themselvesâ€”until I stopped themâ€”by throwing stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they"
hang,of,a,three,caddies,"began playing at touch in and out of the group of bystanders. Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to hang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of"
vaguest,of,staring,had,but,"the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical ideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had left it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was"
rotate,pit,at,first,strangeness,"there, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I heard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to rotate. It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no"
was,education,to,no,scale,"more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowishwhite metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an"
had,contained,it,of,the,"unfamiliar hue. Extraterrestrial had no meaning for most of the onlookers. At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite"
of,the,the,to,ran,"of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About"
thought,early,as,in,my,"eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work upon my abstract investigations. In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much. The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with"
and,exchange,message,the,so,"enormous headlines: A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS. REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING, and so forth. In addition, Ogilvyâ€™s wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms."
by,a,chobham,of,station,"There were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing in the road by the sandpits, a basketchaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there"
was,had,the,dressed,sky,"was altogether quite a considerable crowdâ€”one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others. It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw"
i,in,and,group,it,"was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweetstuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrowload of green apples and ginger beer. Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about"
learned,in,fairhaired,cooler,with,"half a dozen menâ€”Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fairhaired man that I afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a clear, highpitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with"
cylinder,saw,the,its,irritated,"perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him. A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower end was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor."
very,and,my,strange,of,"for very many strange and terrible days. VIII. FRIDAY NIGHT. The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of"
that,it,one,outside,headlong,"the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle with a radius of five miles round the Woking sandpits, I doubt if you would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation"
it,certainly,did,stent,or,"of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the newcomers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done."
the,telegram,hendersonâ€™s,to,killedâ€”decided,"In London that night poor Hendersonâ€™s telegram describing the gradual unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no replyâ€”the man was killedâ€”decided not to print a special edition. Even within the fivemile circle the great majority of people were"
lanes,of,the,have,already,"inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to whom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping; working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes lovemaking, students sat over their books."
went,caused,working,whirl,village,"Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant topic in the publichouses, and here and there a messenger, or even an eyewitness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done"
late,were,and,horsell,were,"for countless yearsâ€”as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case. In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy"
was,trenching,and,the,station,"from the town, trenching on Smithâ€™s monopoly, was selling papers with the afternoonâ€™s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of Men from Mars! Excited men came into the station about nine oâ€™clock with incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might"
a,thought,the,across,fire,"have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the"
lights,border,going,the,burning,"common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there kept awake till dawn. A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the"
searchlight,horsell,went,one,both,"crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and again a lightray, like the beam of a warshipâ€™s searchlight swept the common, and the HeatRay was ready to follow. Save for such, that big"
bodies,of,poisoned,pit,was,"area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of hammering from the pit was heard by many people. So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre, sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,"
was,but,few,in,contorted,"was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there. Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept"
and,immemorial,world,flowed,it,"as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to develop. All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,"
common,of,ever,along,upon,"indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and ever and again a puff of greenishwhite smoke whirled up to the starlit About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed along the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common."
the,in,came,military,busy,"Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing. The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were certainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the"
after,two,men,four,heaven,"next morningâ€™s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started from Aldershot. A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking, saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It"

though,before,breakfast,went,i,"barometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in sleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but a lark. The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went"
that,heard,me,the,told,"round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns were expected. Thenâ€”a familiar, reassuring noteâ€”I heard a train running towards Woking. They arenâ€™t to be killed, said the milkman, if that can possibly be"
unexceptional,strolled,during,and,saw,"avoided. I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then strolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to destroy the Martians during the day."
might,same,another,live,thing,"Itâ€™s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable, he said. It would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might learn a thing or two. He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he"
the,before,pine,pretty,he,"told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links. They say, said he, that thereâ€™s another of those blessed things fallen thereâ€”number two. But oneâ€™s enough, surely. This lotâ€™ll cost the insurance people a pretty penny before everythingâ€™s settled. He laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The"
down,walk,thick,woods,ogilvy,"woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to me. They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil of pine needles and turf, he said, and then grew serious over poor Ogilvy. After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the"
round,saw,the,caps,over,"common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiersâ€”sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf. They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing"
not,the,who,my,so,"sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute"
dog,of,and,i,on,"What for? And Iâ€™ll bring it back by midnight, I said. Lord! said the landlord; whatâ€™s the hurry? Iâ€™m selling my bit of a pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? Whatâ€™s going on now? I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog"
nearly,the,and,so,wife,"cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning"
as,a,one,i,on,"while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth. I shouted after him:"
and,road,stared,a,he,"What news? He turned, stared, bawled something about crawling out in a thing like a dish cover, and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment. I ran to my neighbourâ€™s door and rapped to satisfy myself of"
clear,get,on,wife,my,"what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get my servantâ€™s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driverâ€™s seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and"
of,saw,ahead,the,head,"noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old Woking. In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the doctorâ€™s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head"
to,eastward,i,of,driving,"to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke already extended far away to the east and westâ€”to the Byfleet pine woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with"
the,range,heard,an,faint,"people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machinegun that was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles. Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of their HeatRay."
my,i,him,send,attention,"I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send."
driving,about,sweet,storm,through,"IN THE STORM. Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dogroses. The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury"
and,and,my,and,without,"Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine oâ€™clock, and the horse had an hourâ€™s rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care. My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed"
promise,could,think,it,the,"with forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would"
very,that,into,civilised,my,"that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted. For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last"
i,to,that,in,to,"fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death. It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my"
stood,i,me,i,intimately,"cousinsâ€™ house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. My cousinsâ€™ man lit both lamps. Happily, I knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she"
my,that,turned,not,side,"turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wifeâ€™s fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the eveningâ€™s fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated"
the,masses,i,the,there,"the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western horizon a bloodred glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke."
stood,nor,a,i,happening,"Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know"
sleeping,pyrford,passed,of,little,"if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the night. From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little"
midnight,silhouette,intimation,first,and,"hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its treetops and roofs black and sharp against the red."
been,green,i,a,even,"Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins. I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left. It was the third falling star!"
towards,between,hill,apparition,as,"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted. A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a"
more,have,a,seen,confusing,"succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment, sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the"
i,of,slope,maybury,and,"slope. At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift"
came,the,and,green,crest,"rolling movement. It was an elusive visionâ€”a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright. And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher"
dangling,houses,striding,in,a,"than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in"
great,nearer,and,impression,a,"the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand."
seemed,huge,they,off,as,"Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared, rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether."
of,the,sideways,and,fell,"Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horseâ€™s head hard round to the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell heavily into a shallow pool of water. I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the"
the,water,his,spinning,still,"water, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford."
glittering,and,pace,about,mere,"Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood"
the,as,of,swept,the,"that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fishermanâ€™s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an instant it was gone."
blinding,shadows,the,in,that,"So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows. As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the thunderâ€”Aloo! Aloo!â€”and in another minute it was with its companion, half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt"
over,intermittent,the,metal,and,"this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had fired at us from Mars. For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the distance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it"
them,a,night,then,swallowed,"came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night swallowed them up. I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a"
not,all,position,imminent,this,"drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril. Not far from me was a little oneroomed squatterâ€™s hut of wood, surrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last, and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run for this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear"
were,succeeded,by,i,availing,"(if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and, availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine woods towards Maybury. Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own"
to,through,was,among,was,"house. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage. If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I"
to,so,strangeness,the,bruised,"should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness, prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and blinded by the storm."
sweeping,going,college,house,the,"I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in"
hardest,stress,sideways,just,the,"the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back. He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way"
palings,boots,its,man,had,"along its palings. Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When"
flung,to,body,touched,saw,"it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it. Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was"
flashed,a,for,the,the,"quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed for a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken. I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by the police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing"
the,of,though,common,by,"was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about me were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the road."
sat,monsters,my,latchkey,and,"Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against"
the,the,said,back,that,"the fence. I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall, shivering violently. AT THE WINDOW. I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of"
after,mechanically,moved,went,did,"exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some whisky, and then I was moved to change my clothes. After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I"
our,the,departure,had,enclosed,"do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway."
him,of,hasnâ€™t,hatless,he,"again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was unbuttoned. My God! he said, as I drew him in. What has happened? I asked. What hasnâ€™t? In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of"
then,head,dining,he,he,"despair. They wiped us outâ€”simply wiped us out, he repeated again and again. He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room. Take some whisky, I said, pouring out a stiff dose. He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head"
boy,he,was,to,on,"on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own recent despair, stood beside him, wondering. It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a"
of,metal,in,first,common,"driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second cylinder under cover of a metal shield. Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of"
the,the,the,hole,his,"the fightingmachines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered near Horsell, in order to command the sandpits, and its arrival it was that had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went to the rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind"
out,a,i,the,fire,"him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses. I lay still, he said, scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter of a horse atop of me. Weâ€™d been wiped out. And the smellâ€”good God! Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse,"
parade,the,a,until,he,"and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had been a minute beforeâ€”then stumble, bang, swish! Wiped out! he said. He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively across the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing"
human,the,pit,about,complicated,"order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes"
upon,upon,road,and,common,"scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the HeatRay. In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that was not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of"
time,cluster,artilleryman,still,woking,"them. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last; then in a moment the HeatRay was brought to bear, and the town became a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the HeatRay, and turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards"
cylinder,the,cautiously,crawl,woods,"the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit. The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards Horsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the"
was,and,people,woking,martian,"road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there, frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a"
railway,were,trenches,tree,up,"man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment. Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and"
mains,found,of,got,the,"cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out like a spring upon the road. That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling"
came,me,trying,again,food,"me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came"
and,upstairs,had,was,mine,"darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face, blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also. When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I"
ruins,where,shattered,looked,the,looked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn.
indiscriminate,universal,and,of,east,"Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escapeâ€”a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about"
and,ever,cowls,to,of,"the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the desolation they had made. It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawnâ€”streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished."
we,as,first,were,the,"Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day. WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON. As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs."
to,house,so,place,and,"The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in. He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his batteryâ€”No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go"
with,scene,disastrous,london,and,"with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed. Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my"
a,under,reach,cover,make,"chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me: Itâ€™s no kindness to the right sort of wife, he said, to make her a widow; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him. Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead."
should,with,the,knew,as,"I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active service and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for a flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the illmade road by"
a,spoon,come,charred,that,"which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the HeatRay; and here and there were things that people had droppedâ€”a clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with"
at,here,debris,the,had,"boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris. Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the houses had suffered very greatly here. The HeatRay had shaved the chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be"
the,by,of,body,had,"a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking roadâ€”the road I had taken when I drove to Leatherheadâ€”or they had hidden. We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill."
still,proportion,and,woods,the,"We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of green."
a,the,done,had,lay,"On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it had failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing, with heaps of sawdust by the sawingmachine and its engine. Hard by was a temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,"
heard,everything,the,to,artilleryman,"and everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen. After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers"
of,privates,it,a,you,"riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman told me was a heliograph. You are the first men Iâ€™ve seen coming this way this morning, said"
jumped,into,saluted,the,sight,"the lieutenant. Whatâ€™s brewing? His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted. Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin battery, sir. Youâ€™ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about"
out,a,a,lieutenant,what,"half a mile along this road. What the dickens are they like? asked the lieutenant. Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like â€™luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir. Get out! said the lieutenant. What confounded nonsense!"
jackets,the,were,of,hesitated,"The artilleryman hesitated at the gate. I shall go on, he said. Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind."
stare,yet,stood,not,the,"Itâ€™s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow, said the artilleryman. They â€™avenâ€™t seen that firebeam yet. The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and again to stare in the same direction."
people,some,about,were,were,"Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently"
expostulating,greatest,leave,them,or,"sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his"
i,eh,that,turning,is,"Do you know whatâ€™s over there? I said, pointing at the pine tops that hid the Martians. Eh? said he, turning. I was explaininâ€™ these is vallyble. Death! I shouted. Death is coming! Death! and leaving him to digest that if he could, I hurried on after the artilleryman. At the corner I"
the,back,whole,box,vaguely,"looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely over the trees. No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen"
boating,this,and,golf,and,"in any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed, were packing, riverside loafers energetically helping, children excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing"
meal,and,the,his,a,"variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his bell was jangling out above the excitement. I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain, made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of"
piled,people,whiteâ€”were,as,with,"soldiersâ€”here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in whiteâ€”were warning people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary"
special,and,for,chertsey,we,"traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at a later hour. We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found"
an,at,are,of,across,"ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton"
panic,burdens,even,enable,to,"Churchâ€”it has been replaced by a spireâ€”rose above the trees. Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even"
the,between,shepperton,was,told,"carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get away from Shepperton station. There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable"
people,and,town,would,sack,"human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over there was still. Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was"
inn,ferryboat,or,big,soldiers,"quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours."
the,sound,said,from,thudâ€”the,"Whatâ€™s that? cried a boatman, and Shut up, you fool! said a man near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the direction of Chertsey, a muffled thudâ€”the sound of a gun. The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the"
be,heavily,meadows,of,other,"chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless in the warm sunlight."
smoke,the,and,into,me,"The sojersâ€™ll stop â€™em, said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A haziness rose over the treetops. Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or"
after,away,here,near,martians,"three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished. Here they are! shouted a man in a blue jersey. Yonder! Dâ€™yer see them? Yonder! Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat"
swiftly,towards,and,as,their,"meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a rolling motion and as fast as flying birds. Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the"
in,extreme,that,and,the,"guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and the ghostly, terrible HeatRay I had already seen on Friday night smote towards Chertsey, and struck the town. At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near"
carried,murmur,thrust,to,hoarse,"the waterâ€™s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horrorstruck. There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a movement of feetâ€”a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust"
water,hand,faced,it,thought,"at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible HeatRay was in my mind. To get under water! That was it! Get under water! I shouted, unheeded. I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed"
putting,low,and,feet,ran,"right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waistdeep. Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred"
would,way,leaping,on,splashes,"yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment of the people running this way and that than a man would of the"
nest,generator,and,martianâ€™s,loose,"confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When, half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martianâ€™s hood pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the HeatRay."
in,another,height,moment,on,"In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that"
heart,nothing,gave,the,case,"village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already raising the case generating the HeatRay as the first shell burst six yards above the hood. I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other"
to,martian,body,other,riveted,"four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to dodge, the fourth shell. The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,"
in,something,i,of,momentary,"flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal. Hit! shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer. I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation."

It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the HeatRay now rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to"

It drove along in a straight line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church, smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done, swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into"

As the camera of the HeatRay hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam. In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost"
the,above,hot,i,need,"scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly above the seething and roar of the Martianâ€™s collapse. For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of selfpreservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing"

The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river, and for the most part submerged. Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the"

My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling, like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A man, kneedeep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and"
the,strides,an,that,until,"pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly. At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as"

When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening."
of,by,over,i,they,"Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist. They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing, tumultuous ruins of their comrade. The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the"

The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of noisesâ€”the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses, the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling"
impact,marked,the,nearer,of,"and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the HeatRay went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in"

For a moment perhaps I stood there, breasthigh in the almost boiling water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through"
up,or,fro,a,of,"grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay on the towing path. Then suddenly the white flashes of the HeatRay came leaping towards me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and"

It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward. In another moment the huge wave, wellnigh at the boilingpoint had"

Had my foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing"
and,them,memory,their,between,"but death. I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear"

negligible,and,martians,the,they,"HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE. After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons, the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common; and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible"

Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith, there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of twelvepounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that"

And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with"
square,through,common,an,position,"furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle. And through the charred and desolated areaâ€”perhaps twenty square miles altogetherâ€”that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,"
through,ruined,among,the,but,"through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human"
life,and,third,in,ventured,"proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder, save at the price of his life. It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third cylindersâ€”the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at"
the,abandoned,fightingmachines,dense,and,"Pyrfordâ€”to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide, stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast fightingmachines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke"
i,hills,downs,and,fire,"that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs. And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning"

I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting downstream; and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would"

I followed the river, because I considered that the water gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return. The hot water from the Martianâ€™s overthrow drifted downstream with me,"
the,of,i,direction,mile,"so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank. Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the"

Never before had I seen houses burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay."

Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling. The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my"

I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was"

It is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively. I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I dozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in sootsmudged shirt"

The sky was what is called a mackerel skyâ€”rows and rows of faint downplumes of cloud, just tinted with the midsummer sunset. I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly."
figure,the,were,say,enough,"Have you any water? I asked abruptly. He shook his head. You have been asking for water for the last hour, he said. For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my watersoaked"

His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly, looking vacantly away from me."

Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for"
